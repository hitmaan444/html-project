<h1>The Best Movies You Should Watch</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstelar</h3>
<p>The film tackles profound scientific ideas like black holes, wormholes, and time dilation, making these complex concepts accessible and exciting. It’s a great introduction to theoretical physics while also sparking curiosity about space exploration and our universe.</p>

<h3>GoodFellas</h3>
<p>Scorsese’s direction in Goodfellas is impeccable, blending fast-paced storytelling with stunning visuals, perfect pacing, and creative editing. The iconic long take at the Copacabana and his use of freeze frames and voiceovers help immerse viewers in the criminal world.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knite</h3>
<p>Heath Ledger’s portrayal of the Joker is widely regarded as one of the greatest performances in cinematic history. His chaotic, unpredictable, and terrifying take on the character won him a posthumous Academy Award and has since become the gold standard for movie villains. Ledger’s Joker is the perfect counterpoint to Batman, representing pure anarchy versus order.</p>
